## How It Works

The X Auto Bookmark Bot operates through a series of simple yet effective steps to ensure automation is streamlined and efficient:

**Input or Trigger** — The user defines the trigger, which could be time-based or action-based within an app.
**Core Logic** — The bot processes the trigger and initiates the bookmarking task.
**Output or Action** — The desired content is automatically bookmarked on the Android device.
**Other Functionalities** — Additional settings such as proxy management, retries, or task prioritization are applied.
**Safety Controls** — Includes safety mechanisms like retry limits, error reporting, and backoff strategies to ensure tasks complete without failures.
